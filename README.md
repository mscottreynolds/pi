# pi
Here is how to compute the value of Pi in various computer languages using a simple, short, but effective program. These programs are capable of computing Pi to at least 1,000,000 places.

In my performance testing of some of these programs, the JavaScript, C, and Julia versions take about the same amount of time to compute Pi. The Java version, however, runs twice as fast!
