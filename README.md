# pi 

Here is how to compute the value of Pi in various computer languages using a
simple, short, but effective program.  These programs are capable of
computing Pi to at least 1,000,000 places.

In my performance testing of some of these programs, the JavaScript, C, and
Julia versions take about the same amount of time to compute Pi.  The Java
version runs about twice as fast as the C version.  The Rust version of the
program is the fastest of them all.
